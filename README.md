# job-search-tracker

*still in development - MVP has been achieved.

### Backstory
I graduated from Flatiron School's coding bootcamp back in March. I felt confident in my skill and learning capacity, 
but I hadn't anticipated how much of a full-time grind the job search process would be. Between conversations I'd had 
with experienced engineers and blogposts I'd read online, it seemed like submitting cold applications was the worst 
path forward. The best approach seemed to be all about volume: lots of networking, lots of cold-emailing, lots of coffees, 
lots of projects, etc. I accepted the process, but quickly found myself feeling burnt-out from all the emailing. I wondered 
if there was an easier way. 

At some point, I realized I was one of the last from my bootcamp to get a job. I knew it wasn't because of my skill - humbly, 
I was near the top of my class, and I come from a physics background. I realized my weakness was that the volume of my 
job outreach was quite low. A question then popped in my head: "Could I make this process easier?" I figured I could. 
So I created this project. 

### What it does
I wanted basically to reduce the complexity of the job search process I believed to be helpful. So, instead of having a million 
differnt tabs open, having to manually enter metrics into Excel, having to copy and paste my cold-email templates in cases
when I'd use them, I created a project to store all that information in one place. 

This app:
- Is built with the MERN stack
- Uses Google OAuth and gmail APIs to authenticate users
- Uses Nodemailer to send emails from within the app
- Uses Redux for state management
- Has data visualization with D3; visually displays much of the useful job-outreach-related metrics
- Allows users to create email templates so that they can send emails in-app with customized values

### Thoughts
At bootcamp, I built a handful of fullstack projects. Some of them were impressive and fun to work on, but none of them 
felt important. I built a game, a mock social media platform, and other such projects. This project represents a phase-shift
in my feeling and skill-level as an engineer. The idea for the project originated from a frustrating problem I had to deal with.
Instead of working harder, I tried working smarter. To that end, my job search process has become FAR more efficient. With this
project I feel for the first time exactly why the ability to write software is powerful. 

I will continue to work on this project, as I think it will be helpful to other job-seekers.
